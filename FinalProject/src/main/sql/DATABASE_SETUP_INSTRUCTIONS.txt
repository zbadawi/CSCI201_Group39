Run create.sql once on your computer to set up the database. If create.sql changes,
you'll need to drop the schema (last two lines of create.sql) and re-run create.sql

Then create a file called "sql_username_and_password" in this folder (src/main/sql)
and write your MySQL username on the first line and password on the second line.
This makes sure we can each use a different SQL password because sql_username_and_password
is added to .gitignore

Example "sql_username_and_password":
	root
	password
